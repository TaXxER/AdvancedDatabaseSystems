\subsection{Problem 1: The user statistics have to be collected}
On the moment the SQL statement is being constructed to query the database, the aggregation factor and domain are known. At that moment, these parameters are logged for user statistics.
There are two tables which hold information about the queries. The first table: querylog holds information about every parameter the user is able to affect. Each query results in a new row containing the start point, end point and factor used by the graph and a timestamp when the query was executed. The second table: factorlog holds information about the factors used only: when a query contains a new factor which is not documented set in this table, a new row is appended containing the new aggregation factor. Else the count related to the factor in incremented by one.\\

\subsection{Problem 2: We are unable to predict the domain and aggregation factors from the beginning}

\subsection{Problem 3: We need a tool to calculate the optimal aggregation factors}
\subsection{Problem 4: The offset problem needs to be addressed}
\subsection{Problem 5: The graphical user interface needs some bugfixing and some extra features}
