In the Thur Valley, a sensor network is build up to measure the water level in and around the river. This is done to get a better understanding of the deviation of the water levels over a large amount of time, and can be used for example to access floading risks. This sensor network produces a lot of data which is publicly available for analyzation. 

To allow users to get an understanding of the dataset in a visual way, an application has been developed that plots a graph of the water levels of this river over a selected period of time.
